# Code examples for JSDay Canarias 2019

This repository contains code samples for my presentation "Multithreading in JavaScript",
presented on 9 November 2019 at JSDay Canarias, in Tenerife.

This code generates a Mandelbrot fractal using JavaScript. It can be configured whether this can be done in the main thread, in
a worker (or multiple workers) using `postMessage`, or in a worker (or multiple workers) using `SharedArrayBuffer`.

## Configuring
The following constants in [`index.ts`](src/index.ts) can be used to configure how the application behaves:

| Constant                | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DEFAULT_WORKER_COUNT    | Configures the default number of workers to spin up                                                                      |
| USE_THREADS             | Whether or not to use threads or do everything in the main thread. Setting this to `false` will not spin up any threads. |
| USE_SHARED_ARRAY_BUFFER | Setting this to true will use `SharedArrayBuffer` for thread communication and coordination instead of `postMessage`     |

## Running the application

This app is written in TypeScript, and compiled using Webpack. To run the application, you need to first install the dependencies,
then compile and start the server.

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compile
```
npm run build
```

If you don't want webpack watching for file changes, remove the following line from [`webpack.config.js`](webpack.config.js):
```
watch: true,
```

### Run
```
npm start
```

The app will be started on locahost port 8080.

**Have a lot of fun!**
